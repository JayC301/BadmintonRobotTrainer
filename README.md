This is an university capstone project done in a group of 4. This project is titled Badminton Robot Trainer.

The purposes of this project include 
- designing an automation based badminton robot trainer that feeds the ball in multiple direction
- providing economical badminton robot trainer for badminton beginners

In this project, I was involved in the methodology part. My role in this project is to prepare the 
overall design, including theoretical calculation to estimate the RPM of the wheel to shoot the
shuttlecock so that it will fall on designated angle and position. Also, surveying electronic components
and preparing process flow are parts of the role.
